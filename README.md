# BioCypher meta-graph
Information about pipelines and adapters available in BioCypher, as described on
the GitHub Projects board for 
[Components](https://github.com/orgs/biocypher/projects/3). Uses the GitHub API
adapter to populate the graph and mount it on localhost:7474 using the Neo4j
docker container. To run locally, you will need to have Docker installed and
running. Then, run the following command from the root of this repository: 
`docker-compose up`.

We will make an online version of the graph available soon.
